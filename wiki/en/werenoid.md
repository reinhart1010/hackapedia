# Werenoid
A **werenoid** is an Object who can transform themselves into a fake representation of themselves. This may also include transformation into a humanoid or a virtual character that bears the same characteristics as their human self. 

## Etymology
The term "were" of "werenoid" came from the Proto-Indo-European root term **wi-ro*, meaning "man", while the suffix "-noid" came from the Greek *-oeidÄ“s*, meaning "to be like that". However, some misintepreted the same term as a portmanteau of "were-" (as in werewolf) and humanoid robots. While the latter still fits into the original definition of werenoids, some rootheads have started to claim as werenoids despite originally being a true robot.

## Relationship with avatars
Some werenoids utilize avatars as a medium of transdimensional representation of their identity. However, unlike regular avatars, the identity of every associated avatars is tightly tied to the werenoid, physically and mentally. This means that the werenoid will be sick if their avatar is also sick, and all associated avatars would be gone after the death of the werenoid.

Some werenoids such as [Shiftine](/shiftine.html) also utilize avatars as an attempt to increase their presence and availibility throughout [backups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup) and [multiprocessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessing).
