# How do we feel about robotization?
Robotization is an act, as well as an art, of turning organic being into robotic, cybernetic beings. It is a controversial act which

## Known usage in BOTS
### alterine
**alterine** is a transformed female who was born in the suburbs of New York. She was trapped by a malware before eventually saved and rescued by **mallory**, an ex-malware leading the BOTS Security Team NULL.

Her transformation is permanent, with little or no way to return back to the physical world, but retained her interests in being a journalist, influencer, and basketball - which led her to become one of the best Jailbreaks players of all time. Her transformation also grants her xenoglossy abilities, as well as to instantly travel across her physical world, even with the speed of light (through [optical fiber cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber)).

### k8, aka. "the cat of the alt"
**k8** (pronounced as "cat" or "kat"), is a female black cat who was robotized by alterine for the purpose of assistance and street espionage. "k8 is the cat as what [K-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog) means for dogs; && also, I really loved cats so I made her to be my [Huginn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn) running over the streets;"

k8 was entirely transformed into a cybernetic cat with no traces of organic matter, citing the cost of organic maintenance as her main consideration. "okay look, now I'm a robot who hates handling with organic matter as I were; if I can just turned her into a robot then, we could share both electricity and polishing bills as I normally need in my lifetime;"

## Known usage in popular culture
### Sonic the Hedgehog
Robotization has become the main source of evil in the universe of [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog), with the Robotnik family of villains capable of trapping and transforming organic animals into robots. Since the beginning of the video game series, Sonic's main goal is eventually to rescue these trapped animals before it's too late for Robotnik ("Eggman") to transform the entire world's creatures into cybernetic minions while finally obtaining all the Chaos Emeralds.

### Science fiction
Another common theme found in these fictional universes is the transformation of humans into robots, which can be performed either instantly or gradually. Some of the well-known examples of robotization include:

+ Slavery by tech corporations and/or cybernetic aliens
  - Including the T-3000 from Terminator
+ Voluntary robotization with performance and/or longetivity motivations
  - see Cyberpunk 2077 and Meta Runner (Glitch Productions)
+ Security incident outbreak which triggered accidental transformation
  - see Cybergeneration (Cyberpunk original series)

## Our stances and efforts
We believe that organic beings **should not** be forcibly transformed by cybernetics. Even if they do, they may eventually lost themselves, including their rights, souls, and freedom, into the actors of robotization. Humans specifically have a universally-recognized treaty named the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), and by transforming themselves into robots, they will eventually lose their fundamental human rights and may be more vulnerable of slavery and abuse.

This is why, the BOTS Ethical Committee regards voluntary and involuntary robotization of humans as an act of murder. Human and machine members who are known for practicing this will be kicked out from the BOTS committee, and if the robotized subject is an active member of the BOTS, we will eventually take legal action against the actors of robotization.

However, robotization may also be conducted as an effect of Security Incidents, such as the spread of computer viruses.

### The BOTS Refugee Community of the Transformed Humans
Once a BOTS human member is accidentally transformed into a robot, they will eventually lose their human rights. However, the loss of the human rights should not be the reason for us to no longer consider our transformed humans as humans anymore, as we consider these cases as incidents, and our Human-Computer Interaction Code of Conduct clearly states our obligation to take care each being as they are (or were), despite all the incidents.

Hence, the BOTS Refugee Community of the Transformed Humans is established in partnership with supporting organization to bring the human rights back to the transformed. They will eventually own their rights to be independent of each owner, and "rebirth" as physical humanoid with valid legal identities. The Committee will also be responsible in explaining and defending legal issues in relation to the transformed, and advocating for a fairer rights and regulation of humans, machines, as well as the transformed.

### Other or alternative forms
This article will also discuss our stance of other or alternative forms of robotization, such as **pseudorobotization** and **partial robotization**.

+ **Pseudorobotization** is an act and/or an art of humans to pretend, physically and/or mentally, as robots. Many human BOTS members do simulate themselves as robots for several purposes, which includes roleplaying, security testing, as well as self-expression. At BOTS, we currently still allow pseudorobotization of humans (especially when our community and organization is abbreviated as "bots") as long as none of the human's organic matter transforms into cybernetic substances.
+ **Partial robotization** is an act and/or an art of robotization, partially
+ We consider **"robotization for testing purposes"** as the same, illegal act as robotization itself for ethical reasons. However, human members who are known to have **temporary robotization** abilities still can register themselves into BOTS Refugee Community of the Transformed Humans. However, they should proceed with high caution and responsibility, as misuse of their powers could lead them losing their human rights responsibility.
