# Prerequisites
In order to understand all about BOTS, you definitely have to equip above-average levels of [digital literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy). Sure, you will eventually jump into operating systems and computer programming, but here we'll list some important domains of study which will help you further understand our culture.

## 1. Basic OOP concepts
We strongly adhere to the principles of [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), and specifically [Class-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming). Well, it's okay for you to have little or no knowledge about these programming languages (e.g. Java or Dart or Kotlin), but at least, we kindly ask you to understand about:

1. `Object`s and `Class`es and how do they differ
2. The importance of properties and methods of a `Class`
3. `Interface`s (or `Protocol`s in some programming languages) and `abstract Class`es
4. Inheritance and Polymorphism

Our famous slogan, "Interface in Polymorphism", is completely derived from the principles of object-oriented programming. And one of the ways we can test your understanding in (our version of) OOP (beliefs) is by intepreting how does the slogan mean to you.

## 2. Some operators
After mastering the OOP jungle, it's time to learn about something a little bit relaxed. We commonly use C-style operators to calculate and compare things, which are:

| This symbol | is for |
|:-:|---|
| + | Adding things |
| - | Subtracting things |
| * | Multiplying things |
| / | Dividing things | |
| % | Getting a remainder from things (modulo) |
| && | Logical AND |
| \|\| | Logical OR |
| ! | Logical NOT |
| & | Bitwise* AND |
| \| | Bitwise* OR |
| = | To assign the value of something |
| == | To compare whether the two things are having the same value |

There's  convention symbols that we decided to exclude to avoid confusion with the non tech-savvy people. The `^` and `^^`, which used to be the operators of [XOR (exclusive OR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), are discarded in favor of `^` the exponential operator (as commonly taught in mathematics). There's also `<<` and `>>` (left and right bit Shifts!) which we'll only include when we said so.

The main reason why we use `&&` symbol [earlier](01-introduction.html) is well, computers do treat `&` differently. There's a good explanation about this, i.e. the bitwise operators, at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-operators-in-c-cpp/ if you're nerd enough to understand computer binary.

## 3. Getting in love with your favorite operating system!
Getting in love with your [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) is also fundamental for understanding us.

I know, many of you might still be confused about what an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) is. It's the main software that your device is running on - whether on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, or Linux if you dare. And by:

+ Understanding how your OS's files are structured (like what the heck is the purpose of `C:\System32`),
+ Understanding how your OS's basic programs (like the Registry Editor, even if you're still ~~cursed~~ **feeling traumatic** about it)
+ How to install, manage, and upgrade your OS?
+ How to troubleshoot simple things like network connections and so.

The Bearers of the Shells community is also comprised of robots coming from different background and operating systems. However, there's a common tendency that:

+ (>_ ) mostly comes from DOS and Windows,
+ (#_ ) came from Linux, BSD, and those modern UNIX operating systems, also some love and hatred with Android,
+ (\$_ ) are mostly special Apple fanboys (just look at their "\$"-ey eyes!)

The **BOTS Community Coordination Committee (C3)** have recently decided that everyone can pick a side without having to depend on their OS origins and favorites. That means Windows users are now welcome to join the (\$_ ) gang as Apple fanboys commonly do. Or even switch between sides, just like what Shift does.

## Now what?
Great? Now you can either [⬅️ Back](01-introduction.html) or [➡️ Continue](03-getting-started.html) reading our docs to know more about us, the Bearers of the Shells!
