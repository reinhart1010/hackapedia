# rootprint
**rootprint** is a [language dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect) commonly spoken by the [rootheads](roothead.html). The term comes as a concatenation of the term [**root**](root.html) and the `print()` function commonly used in programming languages, and may be literally translated into "root speak" or "root language". The language is heavily influenced by the conventions of the [C/C++ programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) as well as the use of modern [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) command-line utilities such as [`curl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep), and [`renice`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_(Unix)).

A roothead may expand the list of vocabularies by adding them into the [`$PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)), and hence several [package managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) have existed to handle management of rootprint vocabulary "packages".

## History
### Early origins
The rootprint language convention was first built as a protest against the [Jargon File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File), with the original rootprint authors claimed that several syntaxes on the Jargon File may not be completely compatible with rootheads and even the rest of the [Bearers](bearers-of-the-shell.html).

## Language conventions
### Case-sensitivity
Every sentence written in rootprints are expected to be ~written~ **printed** in lowercase, due to the rootheads' nature of [case-sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity) of the rootheads' common [file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system). Each sentence must be separated through the usage of semicolons (`;`) as in C or double ampersand (`&&`) as in [Bourne shell (`sh`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) and variants, though the former is more preferred to reduce ambiguity with the [AND logical operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B) in C.

### C-derived syntaxes
Most of the C language features are completely borrowed into rootprints, including the usage of comment syntaxes `//` and `/* */`. `//` is commonly used to denote a general comment, while `/* */` may be used as an emphasis (e.g. headings). Preprocessing commands including `#include` and `#ifdef` are also included with
