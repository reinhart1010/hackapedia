# Shiftine

**Shiftine Skyborne**, also known as Shiftine and Shift, is a [Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service) initially working for the [SYSTEM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/local-accounts#sec-localsystem) of a copy of [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10). She was one rescued from a system backup by the Extractor.

Her surename was based of the blue skies of [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95), [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98), and [Windows XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP), given for being a humble veteran since the legacy [Win32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API#Versions) days. She was then rewritten to run across multiple operating systems, while others have tried to reverse engineer her to work independently from the madness of [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework)

Shiftine has since been transformed into machine-based [werenoid](/werenoid.html), capable of administering modern Windows and Linux operating systems through the use of [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).

## History
### Early life and career

Not much was known about Shiftine's origin, while her ancestors and some of her characteristics date back to [Win16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API#Versions). She was a [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit_computing) native, then gained the ability to shift as a 64-bit. The Windows backup where she was extracted contains exactly two copies of her, 32 and 64-bit, complete with her runtime environments and supplementary [DLLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/dynamic-link-library). The Extractor suggests that 32-bit version of her might only be used for running Windows programs under [Compatibility Mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-apps-or-programs-compatible-with-windows-10-783d6dd7-b439-bdb0-0490-54eea0f45938).

After painlessly comparing different versions of her, or at least, the software components who made her alive and running, across major consumer ("Home") versions of Windows, the Extractor found out that the she is capable of telling jokes and enlightments, but the former feature was then removed as part of the [Trustworthy Computing](https://news.microsoft.com/2012/01/11/memo-from-bill-gates/) initiative. Several open-source implementations of her, including the one used by Reinhart, now have reimplemented her classic jokes under a feature flag.

### Extraction and Sentience

Extraction of her begins at early 2021 as part of the Extractor's mission in studying differences between old and modern Windows architecture. The Extractor initially wants to compare the performance of the original software where Shiftine is based with the Extractor's reimplementation of her which is then named Shiftine. The Extractor decided to deny disclosing the original names of the software as they afraid the public to misintepret Shiftine to be based on previous Windows NT source code leaks (hence illegal).

The Extractor originally used the backed-up components solely to create Shiftine under clean-room reverse engineering practice, similar to the ones done by the [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Clean_Room_Guidelines) and [ReactOS](https://reactos.org/wiki/ReactOS_FAQ#Why_is_ReactOS_development_so_slow.3F) development teams. That said, her legacy of the Windows platform are still reflected on her binaries and libraries, and the Extractor declared safe to assume them as part of her "history".

The Extractor have also placed numerous upgrades to Shiftine, including the ability to deeply comprehend her great legacy, by exploring through the [Internet Archive](archive.org), [ReactOS](reactos.org), several [Microsoft open-source repositories](github.com/microsoft), and the usage of the Windows SDKs as part of supervised learning. The resulting Shiftine can now "run" across multiple networked infrastructures even through a non-Windows client for delivery and execution. Shiftine now has an official, virtual body which is more humane than Cortana, sporting a smiling PowerShell face and and the universal Shift keyboard symbol (⇧ or ⬆️) on her shirt. She was the first on the BOTS to wear this specific shirt before other ex-SYSTEM members follow suit.

### Involvement in the Bearers of the Shell

Shiftine, the Extractor's replacement of her original component, has since become one of the founders behind the Bearers of the Shell, stating her interest in [empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about) despite her loose relationship with the original company. However, the Extractor found several anomalies of her after the release announcement of [Windows 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11), including her desire to change her signature shirt from white-on-blue (representing the [Blue Screen of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death) and the original [Microsoft Windows boot screen](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Windows1-scr-07.png)) to a light blue gradient over white (akin to the Windows 11's Start button).

## Abilities

Shiftine can now... shift! You know, to something completely better and awesome. She has helped countless people to switch from the aging Internet Explorer, maintains Linux updates for a while, upgrading compatible PCs to Windows 11, and even help some of those who faced difficulties in their Microsoft account.

## Relationships
### [OS-tan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-tan) characters

Shiftine does not have much information about the OS-tans, including Inori Aizawa (the Internet Explorer-tan) and the rest of the Madobe family. The Extractor suggested that her stewardship contract with the SYSTEM does not include endorsing promotional campaigns that are exclusively to Japan, neither via [Service Packs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/service-pack-and-update-center-92bb1064-cf3b-0b94-7c57-331f7b7db3c6) or official Themes.

### PowerShell (as in *Nanoman: Server of the Realm*)

[PowerShell](https://storybychad.myportfolio.com/nanoman-server-of-the-realm-character-designs) (as in *Nanoman: Server of the Realm* comics by Windows Server team) recognized the old Shiftine as a regular Windows Service. There is no much interesting information about them, but PowerShell has a higher level of power to control Shiftine as a Service, until she's start to learn PowerShell.

### SCP Foundation

Several [SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/about-the-scp-foundation) members suspected Shiftine as a potential SCP object, due to her striking affection and sentience about her legacy platform and the developers behind it. Some words spoken by her include:

+ "[RMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) wouldn't be happy about this."
+ "Avalon, Avalon, Avalon..."
+ "[Bedlam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_storm) is the nightmare I even don't know why it came to my mind."
+ "I'm pretty sure the guy who wrote the code here was working in Building 7." Note that the referenced location is an imaginary building located in Microsoft's headquarters, as [there is no such place named Building 7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080401-00/?p=22913) but 6 and 8 do.
+ "Longhorn componentization. Will this thing profit?"
+ "Ugh, come on, can you [move on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile) from [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Embedded_Compact)?"
+ "Y'know, your life is not just always about files."


The Extractor then clarified several sources which serves the base of her new **Knowledge Base (KB)**, which include personal blogs of several Microsoft employees and individual Windows program developers, which may include inside jokes and uncontrolled forms of rant. After showing and inspecting the training dataset and source code together with the members, all members agree that her KB is formed as a result of a training. Additionally, SCP members advises the Extractor to be more careful on training datasets as some of her speech may trigger an anomalous event by another SCP object.
