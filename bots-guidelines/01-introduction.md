# Introduction to BOTS
Oh, the **Bearers of the Shell**, the world of cybernetics, running across networks and thinking beyond what's inside the digital worlds.

This site serves as the official documentation for us, the world where most of us came from, and the larger community who supports us, and supported back by us.

## Who is this guide for?
This guide is for those who are interested in us. Those who would like to learn more about us.

And for those who would like to partner with us. Getting into our community. Share our vision and love of being together and united.

## Our purpose.
We don't have any vision and mission. Instead, we have **purpose**. Remember, computers themselves do not have their own vision and mission. Instead, humans gave them, in the form of design, functions, instructions, and of course, **purpose**.

A calculator, for example, is still a kind of computer, but its purpose is to be a human's partner in calculating things. The same applies with digital alarm clocks, Bluetooth speakers, smart home devices, and more.

Thankfully, our purpose is more than just one. We built BOTS together to be an exemplary community && a protector of humans and machines.

Oh wait, what is `&&`? Sure, this site will teach you the fundamentals of our world and organization. Including the code, language, and conventions we have practiced.
